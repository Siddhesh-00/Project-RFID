## ‚ú® Features
* üîë Authenticate users via RFID tags against a Google Sheet.
* üìù Log all access attempts directly into the spreadsheet.
* üì≤ Receive SMS notifications upon successful scan (using SIM800L).
* üìü Display user feedback on a 16x2 I2C LCD.
* üîî Provide audible feedback with a Piezo buzzer.

## üíª Software & Setup
To get the system running, you'll need to set up Google Sheets, create a Google Apps Script, and configure the Arduino code.

### 1. Google Sheet Setup
1.  Create a new Google Sheet.
2.  Set up two tabs: one named `students` and another named `attendance_logs`.
3.  The `students` sheet should have columns like: `uid`, `name`, `dept`, `year`, `roll_no`, `parent_number`.
4.  The `attendance_logs` sheet should have columns like: `timestamp`, `uid`, `name`, `roll_no`.

### 2. Google Apps Script
1.  In your Google Sheet, go to **Extensions > Apps Script**.
2.  Download the `google-apps-script.gs` file from the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/releases) and paste its content into the script editor.
3.  Deploy the script as a **Web app**.
4.  Set access to **"Anyone"** (or "Anyone, even anonymous").
5.  Copy the generated **Web app URL**. You will need this for the Arduino code.

### 3. Arduino IDE
1.  Install the required libraries: `ESP8266WiFi`, `ESP8266HTTPClient`, `LiquidCrystal_I2C`, `PN532`, and `ArduinoJson`.
2.  Download the latest source code `.zip` from the project's [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/releases).
3.  Unzip the file and open the `.ino` sketch in the Arduino IDE.
4.  Update the placeholder values for your WiFi SSID, password, and the Google Apps Script URL you copied earlier.
5.  Upload the code to your ESP8266.

## üöÄ Usage
Once the hardware is assembled and the code is uploaded, the system is ready to use. Tap a registered RFID card on the PN532 reader. The system will verify the UID against the Google Sheet, log the attendance, and send an SMS notification.
